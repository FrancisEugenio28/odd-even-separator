#Even & Odd Separator

#Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program will create two other 
#text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. 
#The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.

# create empty list for even and odd
even = []
odd = []
# read input file
with open("numbers.txt", "r") as input_file:
    # for each line
    for i in (input_file):
        # separate the even from the list
        if (i % 2 == 0):
            even.append(i)
# else, store the odd from the list
# write it in the txt file
